.ve-media https://iiif.harvardartmuseums.org/manifests/object/228130

The focal point of the painting is a relaxed young woman smiling at her dog while gazing affectionately at each other. The pair are seated in a striped red and yellow vertical striped sofa. The wall in the background is a deep red color reminding me of wine. The young girl is in a dress of various shades of grey-blue. The top portion of the dress is stripped with vertical light grey and blue lines. The bottom consists of the dress consists of a light and deeper shade of blue. The neack the dress ruffles upward framing her face and the neckline is held together by a blue-grey fabric. Similarly, the girls hair seems to be held together by a blue ribbon. The black dog has a green collor around its neck. Looking closer at the young woman: there is a gold band on her right ring finger. To me the young woman appears to be holding onto thread on her right hand and by her left hand is an embrodery piece. The top right corner has Marry Cassatt's signature and year.
